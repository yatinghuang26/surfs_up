Overview of the analysis:

We are looking for an investor to open up our surf shop in Hawaii, but he is concerned about the weather in the island. From the weather data he provided, we are to analyze it and determine if it is a viable option to open up a surf shop and in which area where it would be the most suitable.

Results:

  1. Use SQLite and SQLAlchemy to extract key information from the data provided in order to help us make the best business decisions.
  2. Determine the weather station with the most and most accurate data so we can ignore bad data if there is any.
  3. Determine the precipitation levels yearly on Oahu.
  4. Determine the yearly temperatures and decide if a surf shop is worth it.
  5. Plot our findings from the data to make it easier for anyone to see the trends.
  6. Create a webpage using Flask so our findings become more accessible to everyone.
  
Summary:

The weather data provided and our analyses seem like it would be a good idea to open a surf shop in Hawaii. Overall precipitation is low year round, so it is safe to assume that business would be steady. June is the start of summer, so it is important to make sure the conditions would be satisfactory to draw in the most business we can. As for December, this is usually one of the coldest months of the year, so the temperature should be the lowest. From our findings, the temperature is still around 70 degrees F so our surf shop should be able to run sufficiently. Besides temperature, it would be helpful to also find out the precipitation levels and the start and end temperatures for these months. Figuring out precipitation levels is not as vital for June, but crucial for December because of lower temperatures. This way, if business is slow, we know the reasion why ahead of time and can plan accordingly. In my opinion, the most important thing to determine is the start and end temperatures. If we know the time of the day with the highest temperature, we can plan ahead with supply and staff. The hottest times will tend to draw in the most customers, so we need to make sure we can service them all. If we are unable to do so, business will go down substantially because it would be difficult to change customers' minds once we provide poor customer service due to reasons we could have prevented.
